Swing API is a set of extensible GUI Components to ease the developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/GUI Applications. It is build on top of AWT API and acts as a replacement of AWT API, since it has almost every control corresponding to AWT controls. Swing component follows a Model-View-Controller architecture to fulfill the following criterias.
* A single API is to be sufficient to support multiple look and feel.

* API is to be model driven so that the highest level API is not required to have data.

* API is to use the Java Bean model so that Builder Tools and IDE can provide better services to the developers for use.
